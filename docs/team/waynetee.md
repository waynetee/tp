### Project: PropertyWhiz

PropertyWhiz is a desktop application that helps property agents manage their properties and clients.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added intelligent matching functionality. [\#97](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/pull/97)
  * What it does: Automatically match buyers and properties together based on price and tags, returning a list of one-to-one matches with the most compatible pair at the top.
  * Justification: This allows the property agent to discover and prioritise the most compatible properties and buyers, and allows them to make better recommendations to their clients.
  * Highlights: This feature required in-depth consideration of the target users' priorities, followed by designing a suitable algorithm to determine the best matching. Adding this command required the introduction of multiple UI views as a concept and additional code had to be added to support the switching of views.

* **Enhancement**: Added system tests. [\#41](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/pull/41)
  * What it does: Runs list of commands from text file and compare output (feedback to user + program state) to previous results.
  * Justification: This allows us to automatically detect regressions in code not caught by unit tests.
  * Highlights: This feature required consideration of the "developer experience". It was implemented in a way that allows developers to easily update it with new input and easily compare the actual vs expected output when the test fails.
